<h3>DemocracyClub</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.democracyclub.org.uk/aboutus/">DemocracyClub</a> is a
<i>"non-party-political group of volunteers"</i>. YourNextMP is working closely

<h3>mySociety</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.mysociety.org/">mySociety</a> is a charity that runs many
of Britain's democracy related websites. YourNextMP uses the postcode to
constituency converter provided using the <a
href="http://www.theyworkforyou.com/api/">TheyWorkForYou API</a> - which thanks
to the <a
href="http://www.mysociety.org/2009/09/21/parliamentary-boundary-changes/">excellent work by Matthew Somerville</a> correctly maps to the new boundaries.</p>
